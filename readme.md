# nornir-network-discovery

Companion code for the **Nornir Network Discovery** series on [The Next Hop](https://the-next-hop.co.uk).

A practical, no-fluff series that takes you from querying your first network device with Nornir, all the way to building a multi-function network discovery tool that gathers interface data, device versions, and CDP neighbours.

## Inventory Setup

Before running any script, update the inventory files with your own device details.

`inventory/hosts.yaml` — define your devices:
```yaml
odin:
  hostname: 192.168.1.21
  groups:
    - cisco_ios
```

`inventory/groups.yaml` — define platform per group:
```yaml
cisco_ios:
  platform: cisco_ios
```

`inventory/defaults.yaml` — set your credentials:
```yaml
username: your_username
password: your_password
```

---

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
python part1_main.py
python part2_main.py
python part3_main.py
```

## Disclaimer

This repo is built for lab and learning purposes. Do not use against production devices without understanding what each script does first.
